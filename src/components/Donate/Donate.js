              <p>
                While the world has all its face towards the vaccine against
                COVID-19, the unprivileged children in India are at a high risk
                of facing contracting deadly diseases as they missed their vital
                childhood vaccinations disrupted by this pandemic.
                <br />
                <br />
                In April 2020, 2.9 million infants missed their first dose of
                the measles vaccine due to this pandemic. Many other vaccines
                are there having a serious illness that infects and even many
                children die.
                <br />
                <br />
                About more than 5 lakhs of children under-fives die every year
                due to lack of vaccine, preventable and treatable infections
                such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and sepsis. If all children are
                vaccinated after birth, more than half of these lives could be
                saved. Since the declaration of lockdown in March, over 13.7
                lakh Anganwadis shut down. As each rural child care center
                ensures that 18 children under six in their care are up to date
                with vaccinations, it affected 2.43 crore children's in the
                first year of their lives and almost all Anganwadis remain
                closed.
                <br />
                <br />
                The longer immunization is delayed for a child, the more prone
                they become to these deadly diseases including Polio, Diptheria,
                Tetanus, and many more.
                <br />
                <br />
                "It is not only dangerous for our children but for the health of
                the whole country, already under siege with the Coronavirus"
                <br />
                <br />
                According to WHO Director, "while the world strives to develop a
                new vaccine for COVID-19 at record speed, we must not risk
                losing the fight to protect everyone, everywhere, against
                vaccine-preventable diseases."
                <br />
                <br />
                These diseases will come roaring back if we do not vaccinate.
                <br />
                <br />
                With such an initiative, we aim to provide all missed
                vaccination to more than 1000+ unprivileged children. Our main
                goal is to focus that each and every unprivileged child get
                vaccinated for preventable diseases such as Polio, Measles,
                mump, rubella, BCG, RV. At 2,000/- per child we will provide a
                cycle of vaccine and will provide a complete 2-year schedule of
                the vaccine.

                With most urban areas still on a lockdown and businesses
                resuming operations slowly, multiple backward communities are
                yet to find a stable means to provide nutritious food and other
                necessities for their families. Many Migrant laborers have been
                forced to move back to their hometown while a large number of
                Daily Wage Worker continue to live in their Home town with no
                job in hand. To help them Starlight Foundation came forward and
                started its new project under Its Humanitarian Relief Program.
                Under this Covid-19 Relief Fund, you can pay to help such
                Families facing Corona Crisis.

                        <p>I've always wanted to donate towards the betterment of the society and i think STARLIGHT FOUNDATION is the best. Platform to start with.
                        Within a week of lockdown thousands of families have no food in their plates & are still struggling It is almost like our moral duty to help such needfull one's.
                        The best part is working with so many like minded people for the noble cause & being able to something about the problem I fell we share hope among those who need it the most. </p>

                        <p>In my journey with STARLIGHT FOUNDATION, I learnt the importance of the little things we take for granted and from these children, I learnt what the exact meaning. of being happy is. Sometimes little things can make a huge difference. Most importantly, I understood that one should never circumstance is. stop dreaming, no matter what the STARLIGHT FOUNDATION made me a more humble
                        and empathizing person. Proud to be a part of this by which I made a clear mindset of not complaining about the setbacks and to face all the challenges no matter what!! </p>

                        <p>I had no idea where to place mine focus and create a positive change in my community. Had various ideas for brainstorming but had no actual direction. However one thing was certain, that I wanted to work with children in foster care. Mostly I wanted to create a "Bright spot" and show the children at the centre that they were important part of the community.
                        an STARLIGHT FOUNDATION was the only platform what I was dreaming for.
                        I felt delighted working with such co-operative volunteers having such good mind set of helping nation to complete the journey of so called a "Developed Nation." </p>
